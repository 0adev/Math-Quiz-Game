### 2. **Game Flow**

#### Starting the Quiz

- Clicking the `startButton` triggers the `startQuiz` function.
- The `startQuiz` function shows a spinner for 1.5 seconds, hides the `firstSection`, and displays the `secondSection` (quiz screen).
- Initializes the score, question index, and correct answer count. Starts the timer and loads the first question.

#### Loading Questions

- The `loadQuestion` function retrieves the current question from the `quizQuestions` array and displays it along with multiple-choice options.
- Each option is created as a button, and clicking an option triggers the `checkAnswer` function.

#### Answer Checking

- The `checkAnswer` function compares the selected option with the correct answer. If correct, it updates the score and correct answer count.
- Proceeds to the next question or ends the quiz if all questions are answered.

#### Timing

- The `startTimer` function initializes a 60-second countdown, updating the `timeDisplay` every second.
- If time runs out, the timer stops and the quiz ends.

#### Ending the Quiz

- The `endQuiz` function stops the timer, hides the `secondSection`, and displays the `thirdSection` (results screen).
- Displays the final score, time taken, and number of correct answers.

#### Retrying the Quiz

- The `retryQuiz` function hides the `thirdSection` and shows the `firstSection` to restart the quiz.
